# yoink_githubdir
This project is to create a script that will take a provided GitHub URL link and download the relevant GitHub file, or directory, into your downloads folder.

# Why
It's a great tool for when you want to get hands on with only parts of repositories, without the getting git involved. 
Instead, we get regex, requests, and a ton of string manipulation involved instead.

# Current Capabilities
Running this script, with 'file' and a GitHub URL as parameters, downloads the raw version of that file into my downloads folder.

# TODO 
Download directories, recursively down, as well.
